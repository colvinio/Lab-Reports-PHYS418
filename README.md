# Lab-Reports-PHYS418

These lab reports were written for PHYS 418 Advanced Laboratory in Fall '23, a class in which I got an A. I did 5 labs overall. 3 of these labs were 'intermediate labs' and took 3 lab periods ("Calculation...", "Determination...", and "Meaurement..."). 2 of the labs were 'advanced labs' and took 5 lab periods ("Examining...", "Test..."). Labs were completed with 1 or 2 partners, but lab reports were written alone. The class emphasized science communication in general, as besides the 5 lab reports, I also gave 2 10 minutes presentations.

Within each folder is the .tex file in which I wrote the lab report and the pdf which I submitted to my professor.
